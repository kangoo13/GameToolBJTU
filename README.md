### Description

We are going to create a TowerDefense on iOS and Android platforms thanks to Unity in 2D Isometric.
The principle of this game is to kill the enemies with tower that you will build on each maps before they reach your castle. The enemies will follow a line that you will be able to see so you will build your towers strategically.

### Problems
 - Lack of knowledge on Unity for most of the members in this group.
 - Making a full game needs a lot of time, maybe more than we have.
 - We are only programmers, and so we don't have much skills on designing models.

### Goals

Our goal is to make in the end a playable game with the less bugs possible.

### User Story

For the User Story there will be first features that are simple and then if we have time we will implement extras.

Simple but mandatory:
- The user can build towers
- The user can chose on the map where to build the towers
- The user can chose which level he wants to play
- The enemies will be killed by the user's towers
- The user will have a castle with 100 Health points (at the beginning)
Extras:
- The user is able to use spells to kill enemies
- The user can upgrade his towers / castle
- The user can see his score
